My life story starts in [Shijiazhuang][1], a small yet comfortable city in the northern China. Spending most of my pre-college time there, I have fallen deeply in love with this place. The people, food, transportation ... everything in my hometown seems perfect for living.

In the fall of 2011, I attended [China University of Geosciences][2] in Wuhan for my undergraduate studies and got the bachelor degree in Geology four years later. After that, I moved to New York City to complete a graduate program in Climate and Society at [Columbia Univeristy][3] and was granted the master degree in October, 2016.

I previouly did physical oceanography research with Professor [Ryan Abernathey][4] at [Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory][5].
